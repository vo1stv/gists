However and whatever you write, you can append notes to the end of your content (assuming some free-space remains). If the language you choose has support for comments, your notes can be appended in a non-intrusive way.

In natural speech, comments may be: 1) parenthetical; or 2) exclamatory; the former is more generally called block-oriented, and the latter, line-oriented. In both cases, the comments are separated from the main content by opening and closing delimiters.  The closing delimited for a line-oriented comment is always a full-stop or line-ending. For block comments, recognizable pairs of opening and closing symbols such as round or square brackets are used. 

To demonstrate how easy it is to append notes in practice, one has been added to the end of this file.
