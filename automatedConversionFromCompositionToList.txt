Computers perform automated conversion of a composition into a list of the composition's component parts. A straight-forward way of doing so in many languages is to use "regular expressions".  A "regular expression" solves the problem of how to detect the markers that separate one part from the next. As the regular expression is applied, it efficiently tests for multiple symbols and keywords juxtaposed within the text. The entire composition is scanned to detect separators that meet these tests: text that meets the tests is given the label "marker"; otherwise the text is labelled "content".  The results are collected into a list alternating from content to marker, content to marker until the entire composition has been split into its component parts.
