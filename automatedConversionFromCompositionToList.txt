Computers perform automated conversion of a composition into a list of the composition's component parts. A straight-forward way of doing so in many languages is to use regular expression.  A regular expression solves the problem of how to detect the markers that separate one part from the next. As the regular expression is appliied, it effectively tests a wide range of possible symbols and keywords juxtaposed within the text. The entire composition is scanned to detect markers that meet these tests: text that meets the tests is given the label "separator"; otherwise the text is labelled "content".  The content and the separators are transcribed and stored into a list until the entire composition has been split into its component parts.
