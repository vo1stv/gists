The word "composition" is defined as "a written work pieced together from smaller parts". Separating one part from the next are recognizable markers -- keywords and symbols such as white-space and headings.  The reader easily splits the composition into its component parts upon encountering these markers.  Once split in this way, the composition can be thought of as a written list whose items vary from content to marker, content to marker.
